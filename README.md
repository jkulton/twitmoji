A Chrome extension to change the heart button on Twitter to an emoji

(This extension is deprecated and no longer available on the Chrome web store)

<hr>

v0.7 - added some emoji, fixed emoji clipping issue :doughnut:

v0.6 - Initial GitHub push, added more emoji options. Cleaned up js, manifest, and put css in folder.

v0.5 - Added extension icon. Tweaked hover effect for emoji slightly.

v0.4 - Fixed a linking error and made code more succinct in the process!

v0.3 - Switched from appending emoji to inserting via CSS. This method fixes an issue where navigating around the site would sometimes not load the emoji since Twitter re-loads only changed content.

v0.2 - Fixed an issue where if a user hadn't yet selected an emoji from the Options page no emoji would show up.

v0.1 - Y DIS NO WORK?
